# Quote_Generator
In this project, weâ€™ll build a random quote generator that displays a random quote to the user every time they press a button.

This is a simple training app based on HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Fething the data in JSON format from the API https://type.fit/api/quotes and saving it in a variable.

Dynamically inserting a random quote into the DOM on initial loading.

User is able to load a new quote on a button 'New Quote" click.

User is able to tweet the quote if he liked it on a 'Twitter' button click.
